Please take the time to read the following, and feel free to ask questions about the study details.  Taking part in this study is your choice.  You can choose to take part, or you can choose not to take part in this study.  You can also change your mind at any time, with no penalty.  The purpose of this study is to better understand how we see and how we think.  In this study, you will be asked to examine simple shapes or images, or to listen to simple musical sequences.  Afterwards, you will be asked to answer questions about what you saw or heard by pressing some keys or using a computer mouse.  Because these are activities that many people already experience hundreds or thousands of times every day, there are no risks involved in this study.  The study may have no benefits to you, but it may help the scientific community come to better understand how the human mind works.</p><h5>DURATION</h5><p>If you agree to take part, the study will last approximately <strong>7 minutes</strong>.</p><h5>COSTS AND COMPENSATION</h5><p>There are no costs associated with participation in this study.  You will receive 1.05 GBP.</p><h5>CONFIDENTIALITY</h5><p>No personally identifying information will be collected, so your participation will be entirely anonymous.  Your data will be pooled with those from other participants, and will be stored in a secure lab server which can only be accessed by the study team members.  Your data may be included in scientific publications. Depending on journal open access requirements, data collected from this study may be uploaded to public data repositories. As the data is collected anonymously, once the survey is submitted, you will no longer be able to withdraw your data.</p><h5>LEARNING MORE</h5><p>If you have questions about this study, you may contact your experimenter Joan Ongchoco at joan.ongchoco@psych.ubc.ca. If you have any concerns or complaints about your rights as a research participant and/or your experiences while participating in this study, contact the Research Participant Complaint Line in the UBC Office of Research Ethics at 604-822-8598 or if long distance e-mail RSIL@ors.ubc.ca or call toll free 1-877-822-8598.</p><h5>INFORMED CONSENT</h5><p>Your participation indicates that you have read and understood this consent form and the information presented and that you agree to be in this study.</p></div></div><h2 style='text-align: center'>PRESS THE Y KEY TO SUBMIT YOUR CONSENT.</h2><p></p><p></p>",89,consent,https://perception.psych.ubc.ca/expts/EC/ExpSS/expt-scd.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      <p>For this study, weâ€™d like you to imagine that you are a new graduate looking for a fridge for your new apartment.</p>
      <p>You have a budget of $2400-$3000, but are hoping not to spend more than $2700.</p>
      <p>Your goal is to find a fridge with as many technological perks at as low of a cost as possible.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In the first part of this study, you will be shown four different fridges at different price points. For each fridge, you will see a list of its different features.</p>
      <p>In the next 3 minutes, just go through the different fridges, as if you were browsing online, and try to see which fridge would be the best for you.</p>
      <p>To navigate between images, scroll up for the next image and down for the previous one.</p>
      <p>We will later ask you to make a selection, and we will then ask a few questions about your decision.</p>
