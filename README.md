# Swiping vs. Scrolling Experimental Pipeline

This repository contains the code I developed to create an experimental pipeline to test if swiping causes memory flushing.
There are two experimental tasks (decision-making and aesthetic), which each correspond to an experiment.

Below are the links to run the experiment:
- decision-swipe: https://perception.psych.ubc.ca/expts/EC/ExpSS/expt-swd.html
- decision-scroll: https://perception.psych.ubc.ca/expts/EC/ExpSS/expt-scd.html
- aesthetic-swipe: https://perception.psych.ubc.ca/expts/EC/ExpSS/expt-swa.html
- aesthetic-scroll: https://perception.psych.ubc.ca/expts/EC/ExpSS/expt-sca.html
